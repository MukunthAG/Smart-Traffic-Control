# Smart Traffic Control

A traffic optimizing simulation, where the entire city is represented as a graph comprising of Intersections and Corresponding Lanes. A basic traffic model is used to generate inflow, outflow and phases which have no conflicts.

Given a traffic state, the goal is to find the best possible signal state. Experimentation is being done on the existence of such state.
