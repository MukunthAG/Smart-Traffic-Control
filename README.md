# Smart Traffic Control

A traffic optimizing simulation, where the entire city is represented as a graph comprising of Intersections and Corresponding Lanes. A basic traffic model is used to generate inflow, outflow and phases which have no conflicts.

Given a traffic state, the goal is to find the best possible signal state. Experimentation is being done on the existence of such state. The below graph shows the road network for four intersections.
