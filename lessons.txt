=> a tuple cannot contain a single value like (x) ---> NOT tuple
=> using nx.draw, opacities only take numeric values, use nx.draw_network_nodes instead
=> handle the attribute arrays directly and update only them as they capture all the info, and can be easily read 
using conditionals
=> all the nodes must have all the attributes, if its irrelevant simply put none
=> Never use plurals for variables!! instead back it up by something very different yet understandable
